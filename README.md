# Snort-Basics
This project aims to introduce developers to network intrusion detection using snort. Developers will learn set up Snort, configure it to monitor network traffic and create basic rules to detect potential threats.


Project Steps
## Step 1: Install Snort
The first step is to make sure that your Ubuntu Operating System is up and running on your VM and that you can ping it from your secondary Operating System (Kali). This means that they should be on the same network or subnet.
On the Ubuntu System, open the Terminal — located at all programs

Open the terminal above and run the sudo apt-get update command to update the Ubuntu packages, this may take sometime depending on your network strength and VM memory specifications.

After that, type sudo apt-get install snort. This command will install the Snort program and its dependencies.

Snort will then create different directories where several files are located. These directories may be found using whereis snort command. It will list every directory containing the phrase snort. The directories created by Snort includes:

•	/etc/snort:- This is the most important directory to the snort user. It contains the configuration and rules files. This is where the .conf file is found and we shall use it later to do some Snort settings.
•	/usr/sbin/snort:- This is the executable binary of the Snort IDS/IPS.
•	/usr/lib/snort:- This contains the shared libraries and files that are used by the Snort executable /usr/sbin/snort and other Snort-related components. These files are essential for Snort's functionality and its interactions with different modules and plugins.
•	/usr/include/snort:- This contains header files and related resources used for compiling and building custom plugins, preprocessors, or other Snort-related extensions. Header files provide necessary declarations and information about functions, structures, and constants that are required when developing software that interacts with or extends Snort’s functionality.

## Step 2: Configure Snort
Now that we’ve understood what snort is and how it is installed, it is time to configure it so as to work as an IDS in our network.
In order to do the above, we need to navigate to the /etc/snort directory and locate the snort.conf file. This file contains various settings that are necessary for the effective working of Snort IDS.

In our case, we shall not cover much of what is inside, but a few of them.
Let’s read the contents of this snort.conf file to see what we can set and what is contained therein. In order to do this, we use the command nano snort.conf — this will open the file in read & write mode where we can be able to edit and save the changes made.
NB: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE ROOT PRIVILEGES WHILE EDITING THE FILE. Use sudo su to switch to the root user and key your password if set.

A file will open in edit mode, scroll to the part marked as step #1.

This is the part where we shall set our home network to which we want Snort to monitor. Here, we shall indicate the full mask/subnet of our home network.
Under the ipvar HOME_NET part, it’s where we set our home address. (Please include the /24 mask). This can be got from your Ubuntu terminal using the command ip a s as below. It is the second inet under the adapter enp0s3

After assigning your home address and its subnet in the section above, it;s time to save our changes and exit. Use Ctrl + x, press Y and then Enter key.

## Step 3: Create Snort Rules
a.	Open the local.rules File: Access the file where you will write your custom Snort rules.
b.	Add Basic Rules: Create simple rules to detect specific types of network traffic, such as ICMP or HTTP.

Step 4: Test Snort Configuration
a.	Run Snort: Start Snort with your configuration file and specified network interface.
b.	Generate Traffic: Create network traffic to test if Snort is detecting and alerting based on your rules.
c.	Analyze Alerts: Review the alerts generated by Snort to confirm that your rules are working as intended.

Evaluation Criteria
•	Completeness: All steps are completed and documented with snapshots
•	Accuracy: Snort is correctly installed, configured, and tested.
•	Creativity: Innovative and thoughtful rules are created.
•	Analysis: Clear and insightful analysis of the Snort alerts.
Additional Tips
•	Explore additional Snort features such as logging to a file, using preprocessor rules, and integrating Snort with other tools.
